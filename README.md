We have searched for a course like this for the past four years. We found this course at georgetown college and they have the lions share of credit for its existance. We simply packaged it in a completely portable manner so any adjunct instructor can teach modern computer based statistics without any outside support. To make it happen you need to have a moodle site and you need to step up to the plate and be the admin of that site. These can be purchased for very low prices ... look here

We bought one of the micro ($9/year) plans in order to make the following youtube video.
