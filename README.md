# R-and-Rstudio-from-flash-drive
This repo will contain moodle course XML data to build an introductory stats course in a moodle site. This video on youtube is a general idea of the course as a variation of Math 111 taught at Georgetown college

We have added a directory called Moodle it contains a collection of markdown documents that can be the basis of various "moodle assignments"  how this works will be apparent once you install the xml file into a moodle course and peruse it.
